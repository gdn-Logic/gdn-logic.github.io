**Stefan Hoffelner (Technical University of Vienna)**  

<ul>
<li><strong>Title:</strong>  The global \(\Sigma^1_{n+2}\)-Uniformization Property and \(\mathsf{BPFA}\) </li>
<li><strong>Abstract:</strong> We show that given a reflecting cardinal, one can produce a model of \(\mathsf{BPFA}\) where the \(\Sigma^1_n\)-uniformization property holds simultaneously for all \(n \ge 2\) which stands in stark constrast to the situation under \(\mathsf{PFA}\). We do this via a new forcing construction which gets rid of the delimitations caused by a good projective well-order of the reals, which has been the sole tool to obtain global \(\Sigma\)-uniformization. This method seems to be very flexible and we expect it to produce a whole zoo of set theoretic universes in which  global \(\Sigma\)-uniformization holds.  </li>

<li><strong>Title:</strong> Good witnesses </li>
<li><strong>Abstract:</strong> Two persistent directions in the study of the properties of
the, so called, combinatorial or extremal sets of reals, sets like
maximal cofinitary groups or maximal ideal independent families, are the
study of their spectra and their projective complexity. In this talk, we
will discuss some recent progress in this area and point out towards
interesting remaining open problems. </li>

<li><strong>Title:</strong> Nonvanishing higher derived limits and characteristics of ideals</li>
<li><strong>Abstract:</strong> Recent years have seen a number of developments in the application of set-theoretic techniques to the study of derived functors, and in particular to the derived functor of the inverse limit. In this talk, we will consider a family of inverse systems indexed by ideals and will discuss the effect that certain characteristics of these ideals have on the vanishing of the derived limits of the corresponding systems. In particular, this will yield a proof of the fact that, if all derived limits of a particular class of inverse systems known as \(\Omega\)-systems vanish, then the continuum must be at least \(\aleph_{\omega+1}\), thus answering a question of Bannister. The talk will contain joint work with Matteo Casarosa. </li>

<li><strong>Title:</strong> Distinguishing between sequentially compact spaces via Katetov order on ideals </li>
<li><strong>Abstract:</strong>The talk is based on the paper "A unified approach to Hindman, Ramsey and van der Waerden spaces" (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/jsl.2024.8">https://doi.org/10.1017/jsl.2024.8</a>) written by Krzysztof Kowitz, Adam Kwela and myself. First, I'm going to survey known results that motivated us for looking for a unified approach to this subject. Next, I will show how to encompass in one manner distinct kinds of convergence in topological spaces considered so far. Finally, I'll show that various results from many papers can be obtained from one theorem.  </li>

   <li><strong>Title:</strong> Nice Infinitary Logics </li>
<li><strong>Abstract:</strong> We define a new class of infinitary logics \(L^1_{\kappa,\alpha}\) generalizing Shelah's logic \(L^1_\kappa\). If \(\kappa=\beth_{\kappa}\) and \(\alpha<\kappa\) is infinite then our logic coincides with \(L^1_\kappa\). We study the relation between these logics for different parameters \(\kappa\) and \(\alpha\). We give many examples of classes of structures that can or cannot be defined in these logics. Finally, we give a different version of Lindström's Theorem for \(L^1_\kappa\) in terms of the \(\phi\)-submodel relation. This is Joint work with J. Väänänen. </li>

<summary>Read abstract</summary>
A topological approach to forcing axioms considers them as strong forms of the Baire category theorem; an algebraic approach describes certain properties of "algebraic closure" for the universe of sets that can be derived from them. The goal of the talk is to outline the link betwen the geometric and algebraic points of view.
The talk is meant for a general mathematical audience. In particular familiarity with logic or set theory is not assumed.

- In a 2021 Annals paper, D. Aspero and the speaker showed that two prominent axioms of set theory which were introduced independently from one another in the late 80's early 90's and which both decide the size of the continuum are compatible, in fact one implies the other. Both axioms are so-called forcing axioms which are also exploited in other areas of mathematics. I am going to provide an accessible introduction to our result.
