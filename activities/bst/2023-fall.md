Tutorials by Jindra Zapletal


Title: Geometric set theory

Abstract: The minicourse will outline the methodology of obtaining independence results in the choiceless theory ZF+DC, as described in the book Geometric Set Theory with coauthor Paul Larson. Within its scope, the method is much more efficient and intuitive than all earlier ones. It allows detailed ZF+DC comparison of various objects currently considered in Borel context.

Lecture 1 Info
Date: November 20, 2023
Time: 13:30-14:30
Place: IMPAN Warsaw, Room 405
Abstract: I will sketch the main concerns, definitions, and general theorems. As one consequence of this development, I will get the following: It is consistent with ZF+DC that there is a non-principal ultrafilter on natural numbers, yet no maximal almost disjoint family of sets of natural numbers exists.

Lecture 2 Info
Date: November 21, 2023
Time: 13:30-14:30
Place: IMPAN Warsaw, Room 405
Abstract: I will show how to stratify the amalgamation arguments used in geometric set theory. I will apply the stratification to independence problems in algebraic geometry: It is consistent with ZF+DC to have a Hamel basis for R but not a transcendence basis for R over Q. For any positive integer n, let Gn be the graph on n-dimensional Euclidean space connecting points of rational Euclidean distance. It is consistent with ZF+DC that Gn has countable chromatic number while Gn+1 does not.

Lecture 3 Info
Date: November 22, 2023
Time: 13:30-14:30
Place: IMPAN Warsaw, Room 405
Abstract: I will show how to obtain independence results in the realm of locally countable descriptive combinatorics. A sample theorem: Let G be a locally finite Borel graph of true chromatic number n. It is consistent with ZF+DC that G has chromatic number at most 2n-1, and there is no Vitali set.

Title: title: The *-version of Martin's Maximum

Abstract: Inspired by P_max, we define and explore the *-versions of various forms of Martin’s Maximum. While the *-version of BMM is equivalent to BMM (by a result of Asperó and the speaker), the *-version of full MM might be strictly stronger than MM and in fact the former isn’t even known to be consistent. The new result will be the construction of a ZFC-model of the *-version of MM for antichains of size \aleph_2. Doing the same for \aleph_3 is a problem that is wide open and leads to interesting set theoretical questions which are currently explored by several people.
