<li><strong>Title:</strong> Nice Infinitary Logics </li>
<li><strong>Abstract:</strong> We define a new class of infinitary logics \(L^1_{\kappa,\alpha}\) generalizing Shelah's logic \(L^1_\kappa\). If \(\kappa=\beth_{\kappa}\) and \(\alpha<\kappa\) is infinite then our logic coincides with \(L^1_\kappa\). We study the relation between these logics for different parameters \(\kappa\) and \(\alpha\). We give many examples of classes of structures that can or cannot be defined in these logics. Finally, we give a different version of Lindström's Theorem for \(L^1_\kappa\) in terms of the \(\phi\)-submodel relation. This is Joint work with J. Väänänen. </li>

A topological approach to forcing axioms considers them as strong forms of the Baire category theorem; an algebraic approach describes certain properties of "algebraic closure" for the universe of sets that can be derived from them. The goal of the talk is to outline the link betwen the geometric and algebraic points of view.
The talk is meant for a general mathematical audience. In particular familiarity with logic or set theory is not assumed.

- In a 2021 Annals paper, D. Aspero and the speaker showed that two prominent axioms of set theory which were introduced independently from one another in the late 80's early 90's and which both decide the size of the continuum are compatible, in fact one implies the other. Both axioms are so-called forcing axioms which are also exploited in other areas of mathematics. I am going to provide an accessible introduction to our result.
