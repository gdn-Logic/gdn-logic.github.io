Baltic Set Theory is an online learning seminar that started in 2021 by Grigor Sargsyan. The aim is to present topics that are of current interest. The material is usually built from ground up making it accessible to wider audience than
just experts.


  <h2>2024 Fall</h2>
the topic is a based on a joint NCN-FWF project that Monroe and i have together. the aim is to study dense ideals, and my portion of the project involves forcing over models of determinacy. the starting point of this construction is Woodin's theorem that assuming V is a model of Theta_reg+V=L(powerset(R)), poset Coll(omega_1, R)*Add(1, omega_2)  forces the existence of an omega_1- dense ideal on omega_1. so the goal of this lectures will be to present the proof of the theorem, we will start slow and cover the background material leading to its proof. there are two documents that contain the proof.

at some point we will go for forcing the existence of strong ideals on omega_2, but this will take some time. please forward the email to all those who might be interested.
