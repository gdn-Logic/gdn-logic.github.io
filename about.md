The Gdansk Mathematical Logic Community consists mainly of mathematicians and students who are either working in or interested in mathematical logic. Our ongoing activities include the Logic Colloquium and the Blatic Set Theory Seminar, but we also organise seminars and conferences throughout Poland in collaboration with other colleagues.
